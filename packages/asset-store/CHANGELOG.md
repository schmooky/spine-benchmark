### Patch Changes

- [`21f0646`](https://github.com/schmooky/spine-benchmark/commit/21f064654363ad3e5ae3492bb6ad096f93fd428a) Thanks [@schmooky](https://github.com/schmooky)! - Switch internal workspace dependencies from `file:..` paths to semver ranges. No runtime change for consumers; required so that the new changesets-driven release pipeline can cascade dependency bumps automatically (a release of `@spine-benchmark/metrics-impact-formula` now forces a matching patch release of every package that depends on it, so the npm registry never has a published `pixi-crawler` referencing a stale leaf package).
